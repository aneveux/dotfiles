# .files

Nothing fancy in there... Just the dotfiles I'm using as well as some information/scripts about my installation. In case it helps anyone I'm really glad you found some information here :)

## dotfiles?

That's basically all of the valuable files I want to keep in sync across all the computers I'm using...

## Environment

I'm running [Manjaro](https://manjaro.github.io/). Here are a few things I installed on it (alphabetical order):

`sudo pacman -S ansible atom docker docker-compose dropbox filezilla firefox git gvim keepass numix-manjaro-themes numix-reborn-icon-themes numix-themes terminator thefuck thunderbird tmux vim yaourt zsh`

But also from AUR:

`yaourt -S flux franz`

Of course there are already a lot of things included in Manjaro out of the box. But do not hesitate to mention me anything that you might think would be worth a try :)

## Bonuses?

I'm also using a couple additional tools:

- [SDKMan](http://sdkman.io/install.html) for managing stuff like Maven, Gradle, Kotlin, Java, Groovy, etc. binaries.
- [Oh My ZSH!](http://ohmyz.sh/) for all the goodies it includes :)
- [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k) for a fancy looking prompt!
- [Awesome Terminal Fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) cause I like fancy stuff a lot.
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) which I use more than Atom I believe... (but I'm like changing editors all the time...)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for Java, Kotlin, and all those JVM related stuff.
- [Vim Bundles by spf13](http://vim.spf13.com/) cause they just contain all the things I want in vim.
